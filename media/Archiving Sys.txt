Banks often prioritize security, reliability, and performance, which makes Java a popular choice for developing their systems. Here’s an alternative tech stack using Java and related technologies that would fit well within a traditional banking environment:

### Front-end
- **Java with Spring Boot:** Instead of React, you can use Java Server Faces (JSF) 
  or Spring MVC for server-side rendering and building robust UIs.

- **Thymeleaf or JSP:** 
These are templating engines commonly used with Spring for dynamic HTML generation.

- **Spring Security:** For managing security, authentication, and authorization.

- **Bootstrap:** For responsive and modern CSS styling.

### Back-end
- **Java with Spring Boot:** A powerful framework for building scalable and secure back-end services.
- **Hibernate:** For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with the database.
- **PostgreSQL or Oracle Database:** Robust relational databases widely used in banking systems.
- **Redis:** You can still use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication.

### Key Features
#### 1. Search and Performance
- **Database Indexing:** Implement indexing on frequently searched fields.
- **Redis Caching:** Continue using Redis for caching.
- **Pagination and Lazy Loading:** Implement pagination for large datasets.

#### 2. Security
- **RBAC:** Use Spring Security to implement Role-Based Access Control.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit using SSL/TLS.
- **Secure Session Management:** Use Spring Security's session management features.
- **Regular Automated Backups:** Ensure backups are encrypted and stored securely.
- **Audit Logging:** Implement audit logging for all data modifications using Spring Boot’s logging features.

#### 3. Infrastructure
- **Docker:** For containerization.
- **Nginx:** As a reverse proxy.
- **AWS/Azure/GCP:** For cloud hosting.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Jenkins or GitLab CI for automating your build, test, and deployment processes.

This alternative stack aligns well with the typical technology choices in the banking industry, ensuring compatibility, security, and scalability. If you need further customization or specific advice on any part of this stack, feel free to ask!
